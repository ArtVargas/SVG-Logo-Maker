# SVG-Logo-Maker

The task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. This application was created in order to be able to implement Node.js in order to have a command-line application that has the functionality and capabilities of creating a logo with different background colors which will then be saved as an SVG File. It will prompt the user within the command line which will then give them the option of being able to choose which shape they would like to implement for their logo, the color of their text, etc. It was kept to be simple to not overwhelm the user so selection of shapes included Triangle, Square, and Circle. Once the user answers all of the following prompts the logo of their choosing will be written in an SVG file. This application proved to be extremely challenging due to having this be a first time attempt of being able to utilize all the necessary information of testing the code that enables various information regarding the shape sizes and color from the command-line. It was very much a trial and effort based take on creating this application which had various challenges mostly due to inexperience and not enough practice. What makes this project stand on it's own is notably being able to implement various code displaying various functions classes to fit the specifics of what the assignment was asking. So much was learned through trial and error. It is still taking some time getting adjusting to use Node.js but in time skills will be perfected through study and practice. The future development of this project could enable more polygons, SVG colors, and more customization variety for the user to be able to input and select from.
